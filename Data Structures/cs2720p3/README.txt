Project 3

All of the files in this project represent my own work.

HOW TO USE MAKEFILE:
-typing "make" will compile all necessary code
-typing "make run" will execute DataGenerator.cc which is the main program
-typing "make clean" will remove the executables and pre-processed header files

NOTES:
-I had to use a long for all of the comparison variables because I came across an issue for arrays of length 100000 getting too many comparisons and overflowing
-I have MergeSort.h and InsertionSort.h with just forward declarations of functions and the full implementation is in their respective .cc files
-The above allows for preprocessed headers
-I didn't do error checking on the user input since the project never explicitly stated to do so
-I put the curves in a pdf in this folder and it will be submitted in the same manner as the files, I also intend to submit the pdf in the dropbox for project 3
