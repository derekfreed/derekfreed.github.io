Project 1: Doubly Linked List

The files that I am submitting represent my own work. Derek Freed 10/14/2014

-Run the program with the Makefile commands, this will give you executables for test1 and test2
-use the ./test1 and ./test2 commands to run the test code.
-test codes perform all possible operations for the templated Doubly Linked List class
-all code for templated class is in list1.h since templated classes shouldn't be split into .h and .cc

Project comments:
-I chose to use spaces instead of commas due to personal preference of print formatting-I hope this isn't an issue for grading
