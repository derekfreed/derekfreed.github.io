Catch 'Em All Game - Project 1 CSCI4070

The objective of Catch 'Em All is to survive as long as you possibly can and catch as many
pokemon as you can. The Player has an Ash sprite that is attached to the left side of the
screen and is animated appear to be walking to the right. The background is made to scroll 
or parallax to the left to create the illusion of walking.  Pokemon then randomly spawn on
the right side of the screen and go towards the right with a random y velocity. The player
can hit the space bar to throw pokeballs at pokemon in order to catch them. If the pokeball
collides with a pokemon, the player gets 1 point. If a pokemon collides with the player
then the player loses and the game transfers to the losing screen displaying the score.
The player can then hit enter to restart the game.
