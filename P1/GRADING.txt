Catch 'Em All Game - Project 1 CSCI4070

Definition of Game Objects:
	I have 4 Objects that I use in my game including Pokemon, Player, Pokeball,
	and Background.
Animation of Game Objeccts:
	I have pokeballs animated to move in x direction when spacebar is tapped.
	Pokemon move in the x direction and a random y direction. The player is 
	also animated to look like he is walking. My background is a scrolling background
	so it is animated to move in the x direction and redraw itself if it leaves the
	screen.
Interaction between Game Objects:
	Pokeballs can hit Pokemon to catch them and Pokemon can hit Player to make Player
	lose.
Keeping Score:
	Player gets 1 point per pokemon caught and it is displayed in top left corner.
Compexity:
	My enemies are randomly selected from a large spritesheet and then spawn at a 
	random x position with a random y velocity. The player is also animated to walk
	across a scrolling background.
Documentation/Files:
	I have all necessary files to run the project. I have a readme.txt, grading.txt.
	report.txt, screenshots, javascript files, images for sprites, and driving html
	file.
Demo/Project Gallery:
	My gallery is at derekfreed.github.io
